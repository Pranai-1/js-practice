Functions are first-class objects Which means:
**You can assign them to variables
**Pass them as arguments to other functions
**Return them from other functions
**Add properties to them (just like any object)

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

typeof greet            // "function"
greet instanceof Object // true
greet instanceof Function // true

You can even create functions like this:
const sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
console.log(sum(2, 3)); // 5

Every function is an object, but not every object is a function

If an object has multiple properties with the same key, the last one defined will overwrite the previous ones and the position 
will be the first one.
